description: >
    An analysis guide for a continuous conduction mode (CCM) buck converter. The guide 
    focuses on component sizing, theory of operation of the converter (including waveform analysis and efficiency calculations) and 
    small-signal analysis of the converter. The equations provided give the designer a starting point
    for designing a closed loop system for a CCM buck converter.

### Hello world!
Yes sir.

<Equation expression="\frac{Rload*Vin*(C1*RC1*s + 1)}{(Rload*(C1*RC1*s + 1) + (C1*s*(RC1 + Rload) + 1)*(D*RQ1 + L1*s + RL1))}" />
