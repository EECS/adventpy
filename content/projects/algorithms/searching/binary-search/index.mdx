# ALGORITHM:

To continue our algorithms series, let's now discuss a fundamental search algorithm, binary search.
This will be the first search algorithm in our series, and really is a fundamental search algorithm
that everyone should understand. Fortunately, it's not that difficult, so let's break down its workings.
First, let's look at the time complexity of searching for the algorithm.

# Time Complexity: Worst: O(lg<i>n</i>)

The binary search algorithm, when applied to a list, has a worst-case time complexity of O(lg<i>n</i>). To
achieve this search time complexity, it is assumed that the list to be searched has already been sorted.

The binary search algorithm achieves this time complexity by eliminating half of the list that it searches
at each search interval, deciding if the value at the searched index in the list is greater than, equal to
or less than the value that we are searching for.

Depending on the value in the list, we then only search the section of the list that could return the value
that we are searching for. So, if the midpoint value is greater than the value we want to find, we would then
only look at the beginning half of the list to determine if the searched value is in the list.

The opposite is true of the midpoint value is less than the value we want to find. If so, we would then
only look at the latter half of the list.

Let's run through a small example of the workings of binary search to formalize these ideas.

    Input List: [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 11]
    Find Value: 10

In this example, we have the list as shown above, and we want to find the value 10 in the list. Let's look at each
respective pass of binary search.

    Midpoint Index: 3
    Midpoint Index Value: 6
    Midpoint Index Value Compared to Searched Value: Less than (6 < 10)

    Newly Searched List:
    [6, 8, 10, 11]

This first pass determines that our midpoint of the list is at index 3 of the list, where there is a value of 6 in the list.
We see that 10 is greater than 6, so we only want to look at values greater than 6 in the input list as we will not
find our searched value below 6 in the list.

    List: [6, 8, 10, 11]
    Midpoint Index Value: 8
    Midpoint Index Value Compared to Searched Value: Less than (8 < 10)

    Newly Searched List: [8, 10, 11]

Again, we see that the value at the midpoint of the list is less than our searched value. So again we only search values in the
list that are greater than our older value.

    List: [8, 10, 11]
    Midpoint Index Value: 10
    Midpoint Index Value Compared to Searched Value: Equal to (10 = 10)

    Return Index in original list (5)

Finally, we see the value at our searched midpoint of the new list is equal to the value that we are searching for in the list.
With the value found, we return the index in the list at which the value exists, and search terminates.

We can now see the advantage that binary search presents, given a sorted list. Instead of checking all values in the list,
we can choose a pivot point in the list to search against, and continuously shorten the size of the list that we search in
order to potentially find our value in a quicker manner.

Let's now check out the python code that implements binary search.

# CODE:

    def binary_search(arr, num):
      '''
      Perform binary search on a previously sorted array
      arr (list) - Sorted list.
      '''
      start = 0
      end = len(arr)-1

      while end > start:
          mid = ((end - start)//2) + start

          if num == arr[mid]:
              return mid
          elif num > arr[mid]:
              start = mid+1
          else:
              end = mid-1

      return end if arr[end] == num else -1

In the code above, we see that our binary_search function takes in two parameters, an array to be searched and number that
we are searching for in that array. We then begin the binary search process, by picking a starting and ending index
in the list that we use to determine the midpoint index in the list.

Search continues while the staring index is less than the ending index. This implementation requires this condition because
of the equation that sets the midpoint index. Because it uses integer division and updates the midpoint index during each
pass by adding or subtracting 1 from the current midpoint index, it is possible that the end index variable is set to a value
that is below the starting index variable.

If this instance occurs, we want to finally check the value at the ending index of the array before determining if the value
exists in the list.

Other than that, this implementation is identical to the implementation described above.

# CONCLUSION:

This post talked about the binary search algorithm, a fundamental search algorithm with a simple python implementation.
We will continue to discuss search algorithms in future posts.
