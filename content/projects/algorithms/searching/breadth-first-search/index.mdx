# ALGORITHM:

Let's talk about some tree searching and traversal algorithms. Our first discussion of
tree traversal algorithms will begin with breadth-first-search (BFS) traversal of a tree.

First, let's understand the tree structure that we are to be sorting. Each node that
we add to the tree will be stored in a key-value dictionary, representing the edge
that exists between the two nodes in the graph.

Let's look at what a tree might look like:

                   1
              2         3
            4   5    11   12

In the the tree shown above, we can see that 1 is at it's root, and there are two
subtrees below the root node in the tree.

When we execute breadth first search on this tree, we want to print the value at the
root node of a specific height in the tree, and then traverse and print all other nodes
at the same height in the tree, prior to proceeding into deeper levels in the tree.

We also will be traversing the tree in a left-to-right manner, so let's take a look
at what we would expect the BFS traversal algorithm to print when it goes through
this tree.

        Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11, 12

As can be seen, we start at the root node of 1, and then we progress to the next lowest
level in the tree and print all leaves at that level of the tree. In this instance,
leaves 2 and 3 come next, before finishing our traversal at the bottom level of the tree.

The code itself is not too difficult to understand so let's look at that next.
A "Graph" class has been created for this problem as it allows us to add
functionality, like depth first search, which will be discussed in future posts.

# CODE:

    class Graph:
        def __init__(self):
            self.graph = defaultdict(list)

        def add_edge(self, v1, v2):
            self.graph[v2].append(v1)
            self.graph[v1].append(v2)

        def BFS(self, source):
            print("Breadth First Search:")

            visited = [False] * len(self.graph)

            # Create a queue for breadth first search
            queue = []

            queue.append(source)
            visited[source] = True

            while queue:
                root = queue.pop(0)
                print(root, end=" ")
                # BFS searches all nodes that touch the root first.
                # DFS will search all nodes that touch the root, prior to
                # continuing to search the root node.
                for node in self.graph[root]:
                    if visited[node] == False:
                        queue.append(node)
                        visited[node] = True

        def __str__(self):
            return str(self.graph)

We create our graph as a dictionary in python, and have given the "Graph" class a method
"add_edge" that places an edge in the graph when called.

The "BFS" method in the "Graph" class is where our breadth-first-search algorithm is implemented.
This implementation relies upon a visited list to keep track of nodes that have already been
visited, as well as a queue to track which nodes are to be visited next in the graph.

As we traverse the tree, we place nodes in our queue if they have not been visited yet, and
always traverse the direct leaves of our "root" node in the search prior to moving deeper
into the tree, ensuring that nodes closer to the root of the tree are visited prior to nodes
deeper in the tree.

# CONCLUSION:

This post talked about the breadth-first-search tree traversal algorithm. We will next
see depth-first search, and how it's implementation differs from breath-first-search.
