# ALGORITHM:

After working on many Hacker Rank problems, I wanted to delve into more general algorithm and data structure problems, regardless of
whether they are listed on the hacker rank website. This first post will discuss the quick sort algorithm, it's time complexity and
implementation in python.

# Time Complexity: Worst: O(n<sup>2</sup>) Best: O(<i>n</i>lg<i>n</i>) Average: O(<i>n</i>lg<i>n</i>)

The quick sort algorithm is a recursive algorithm. It begins by selecting a pivot point in the list of numbers that is to be sorted,
and then it sorts the list by dividing the original list into smaller sublists. These sublists contain elements of the original
list that are greater than the pivot, less than the pivot, and equal to the pivot.

For all numbers in the list that are greater than the pivot, or less than the pivot, the quick sort algorithm is called recursively
on the sublists and those lists are then sorted using the same algorithm.

On average, the quick sort algorithm has a time complexity of O(<i>n</i>lg<i>n</i>) as each functional call will be sorting a
list of n/2 elements in length. At worst, if the pivot selected is greater than all other elements in the list, then the algorithm
will have a time complexity of O(n<sup>2</sup>) as the list to be sorted stays at length n, as compared to being reduced to n/2 on the
average case.

The code below implements the quick sort algorithm as described above. If you want more information on the quick sort algorithm,
see the link <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/sorting-algorithm-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">here.</a>

# CODE:

    def quicksort(arr):
        if len(arr) == 1 or len(arr) == 0:
            return arr

        pivot = arr[len(arr)-1]

        left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]
        mid = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]
        right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]

        return quicksort(left) + mid + quicksort(right)

# CONCLUSION:

This post talked about the quick sort algorithm, a fundamental sorting algorithm with a relatively simple python implementation.
We will continue to discuss sorting algorithms in future posts.
