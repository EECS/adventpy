# ALGORITHM:

In continuing our series on algorithms, specifically sorting algorithms, we will be discussing radix sort in this
post. The previous sorting algorithm discussed, quick sort, can be seen in the post <a href="../quick-sort" target="_blank">here.</a>

This sorting algorithm can achieve O(n) time complexity given the element range in the list is much smaller
than the length of the list itself.

A good cheat sheet for the running time of the radix sort algorithm can be found <a href="https://www.interviewcake.com/sorting-algorithm-cheat-sheet" target="_blank">here.</a>

For a good explanation regarding the workings of radix sort, as well as a good breakdown of its running time complexity, see <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/radix-sort/" target="_blank">here.</a>

# Time Complexity: Worst: O(n) Best: O(n) Average: O(n)

In some short words, I will describe the algorithm behind radix sort. The radix sort algorithm builds upon the counting sort algorithm, but does so by
counting significant digits of each number in the input list, as compared to counting each instance of numbers in the list.

To make this more concrete, I will run through an example. We start with a list, seen below:

    [100, 23, 35, 46, 15, 2]

When we run our radix sort, we sort the list by the current signficant digit position for our sort, i.e. at the "1's" place for
each number on this first pass. This looks as so after this pass:

    [100, 2, 23, 35, 15, 46]

Whereever there are multiple numbers with the same significant digit to be sorted (15 and 35 in the "1's" place instance), the first digit in the
list will be seen first in the newly sorted list. Now to sort the "10's" place:

    [100, 2, 15, 23, 35, 46]

Again, we see that 100 and 2 have a conflict as both have a sorted signficant digit of 0, so 100 comes first in the newly sorted list as it was the
first number in the previously sorted list. Finally, we sort by the "100's" place:

    [2, 15, 23, 35, 46, 100]

All numbers except for 100 have a sorted digit of 0, so all of them can be seen in the list in the order they were sorted in previously, with 100
now placed at the end of the list. On each sorting pass through the list, we guarantee that the resulting sorted list is sorted from the
perspective of the sorted significant digit. Onto the code.

# CODE:

    def radix_sort(arr):
      sorted_array = [0] * len(arr)
      count_array = [0]*10

      def get_digit(num, n):
          '''
          Gets the nth digit in a number num.
          n (int): 1 returns 1's place of num, 2 returns 10's place
          of num, etc.
          '''
          return num // 10**(n-1) % 10

      sorted = False
      digit_place = 1

      while not sorted:
          sorted = True

          for num in arr:
              digit = get_digit(num, digit_place)
              if digit != 0:
                  sorted = False

              count_array[digit] += 1

          # Adds positioning for digits in count_array.
          # e.g. small list [3, 2, 1] representing 3 0's,
          # 2 1's, 1 2. The output list would be [3, 5, 6]
          # Then the sorted array can be built in reverse order
          for digit in range(1, 10):
              count_array[digit] += count_array[digit - 1]

          for current_number in arr[::-1]:
              index = get_digit(current_number, digit_place)
              sorted_array[count_array[index]-1] = current_number
              count_array[index] -= 1

          # print(sorted_array)
          digit_place += 1
          arr = sorted_array
          count_array = [0]*10

      return sorted_array

The comment in the above code at line "# print(sorted_array)" can be removed to see how the list is sorted at each specific
significant digit during the sorting process.

# CONCLUSION:

This post talked about the radix sort algorithm, a different approach to sorting algorithms that allows for sorting in
O(n) time given input lists that satisfy specific conditions.
