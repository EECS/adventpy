# PROBLEM:

The problem text can be found at the following link in the Hacker Rank website <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/countingsort1" target="_blank">here.</a>

A brief overview of the problem has been inserted in the webpage below, directly taken from the Hacker Rank website.

    Overview:
    Given a list of integers, count and output the number of times each value appears as a list of space-separated integers.

    Function Description

    Complete the countingSort function in the editor below. It should return an array of integers where each value is the
    number of occurrences of the element's index value in the original array.

    countingSort has the following parameter(s):

        arr: an array of integers

# INTERPRETATION:

Normally, my approach to these problems is to work through an example problem, interpret my algorithm used in dissecting that example problem into
english, followed by taking that english explanation and turning it into a pseudocode implementation, prior to beginning to code.

However, with this problem, I think the description in the problem is simple enough to understand, and the solution is straightforward. So let's jump
into the code and dissect it.

# CODE:

    # Complete the countingSort function below.
    def countingSort(arr):
        n = 100
        counts = {num:0 for num in range(n)}

        for number in arr:
            counts[number] += 1

        return [counts[number] for number in range(n)]

# EXPLANATION:

Line 1 of the program begins by defining a constant n at 100. This is a constraint in the problem and is a safe assumption in this context,
however this would need to be updated if the maximum number in the array arr could be greater than 100 (technically 99).

Next, we create a dictionary "counts", using python's dictionary comprehension convention, where the key is an integer in the range from
[0, 100) (100 is not included for those unfamiliar with this convention), and the value is set to 0. The value in this dictionary for
each integer key in the dictionary will represent the count of the integer in the passed array arr.

We then loop through every number in the array arr, incrementing the number in the counts dictionary each time it is seen in the array arr.

Finally, we return a list, using list comprehension, which contains the count of each number seen in the array arr. So, at index 0
of the returned array we will find the count for the number of 0's in the array arr, etc.

# CONCLUSION:

The algorithm above passes all tests in the hacker rank testing ground for the countingSort1 function. We will continue our
exploration of the counting sort algorithm in this post <a href="../countingSort2" target="_blank">here.</a>
