# PROBLEM:

The problem text can be found at the following link in the Hacker Rank website <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/countingsort2" target="_blank">here.</a>

This problem is an extension of a problem that we discussed previously, in <a href="./countingSort1" target="_blank">Counting Sort - Part 1.</a>

A brief overview of this problem has been inserted in the webpage below, directly taken from the Hacker Rank website.

    Challenge
    Given an unsorted list of integers, use the counting sort method to sort the list and then print the sorted list.

    Function Description

    Complete the countingSort function in the editor below. It should return the original array, sorted ascending, as an array of integers.

    countingSort has the following parameter(s):

        arr: an array of integers

# INTERPRETATION:

As with Counting Sort Part 1, this problem seems to be fairly straightforward. As we already solved the previous iteration of the problem,
and this iteration of the problem is simply an extension of Part 1 of the problem, we'll again jump right into the code solution as seen
below.

# CODE:

    # Complete the countingSort function below.
    def countingSort(arr):
        #To be more flexible with input lists, even though n is
        #100 in this problem.
        n = max(arr)
        counts = {num: 0 for num in range(n+1)}

        for num in arr:
            counts[num] += 1

        sorted_arr = []

        for num in range(n+1):
            instances = counts[num]
            if instances > 0:
                sorted_arr.extend([num]*instances)

        return sorted_arr

# EXPLANATION:

In this iteration, we begin by defining n as the maximum value in array arr. As in the previous problem, we do have a problem constraint
that n is less than 100, however in an attempt to generalize this solution slightly, we define n based upon the elements in the array.

In this particular implementation, n could be larger than 100 and the code would execute correctly.

Moving on, we again create a counts dictionary using python's dictionary comprehension, where the keys are all integers in the range [0, n],
and the values represent the amount of times that each integer is seen in the array arr. This value is initialized to 0 upon creation for
all integers in the said range.

We then loop through all numbers in the array arr, determining the count for each number in that array.

Finally, the newer piece of functionality is seen in the last "for" loop of the function. We once again iterate over all integers
in the range [0, n], determining the number of instances of the integer in array arr.

As long as that instance is greater than 0, we append the integer to the sorted_arr list an "instances" number of times. Because
we loop through the numbers from [0,n] in an ascending order, we are guaranteed to return a list of sorted values in ascending
order.

# CONCLUSION:

The algorithm above passes all tests in the hacker rank testing ground for the countingSort2 function. We will continue our
exploration of sorting algorithms in future posts. Have a great day!
