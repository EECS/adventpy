# PROBLEM:

The problem text can be found at the following link in the Hacker Rank website <a href="https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/insertionsort2/" target="_blank">here.</a>

A brief overview of the problem has been inserted in the webpage below, directly taken from the Hacker Rank website.

    Overview:

    In Insertion Sort Part 1, you inserted one element into an array at its correct sorted position.
    Using the same approach repeatedly, can you sort an entire array?

    Guideline: You already can place an element into a sorted array. How can you use that code to build
    up a sorted array, one element at a time? Note that in the first step, when you consider an array with
    just the first element, it is already sorted since there's nothing to compare it to.

    In this challenge, print the array after each iteration of the insertion sort, i.e., whenever the next element
    has been inserted at its correct position. Since the array composed of just the first element is already sorted,
    begin printing after placing the second element.

    Functional Description:

    Complete the insertionSort2 function in the editor below. At each iteration, it should print the array as
    space-separated integers on a separate line.

    insertionSort2 has the following parameter(s):

        n: an integer representing the length of the array

        arr: an array of integers

# INTERPRETATION:

This problem is the next iteration of the problem that was seen <a href="../insertionSort1" target="_blank">here</a>. In this problem, we do not assume anything about the
given array that needs to be sorted. Fundamentally, we will draw upon the solution seen previously but we will update it slightly so that it can generalize to
an array that may be entirely unsorted. Let's begin with a toy example seen below.

## EXAMPLE:

    Input:
        [3,4,7,5,6,2,1]
    Output:
        [3,4,7,5,6,2,1]
        [3,4,7,5,6,2,1]
        [3,4,5,7,6,2,1]
        [3,4,5,6,7,2,1]
        [2,3,4,5,6,7,1]
        [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

In this problem, we want to begin our search through the list at an index of 1, as the value at index 0 is by definition sorted as there are no values prior
to it in the list. At index 1, we see that the value of 4 is sorted is compared to all previous values in the list (3), so we do not want to move it in the list
and we print the list out and continue our traversal at the next element.

Again at index 2 we receive a value of 7 that is sorted as compared to all previous values in the list (3, 4), so once again we print the list out and continue
our traversal. At index 3, we receive a value of 5, which is not sorted with respect to the value at index 2 in the list (7). To sort this value, we want to
shift all values in the list beginning with the value (7) that is greater than our current value in the list (5), and ending the shifting at our current value
in the list (5).

When this shifting is completed, we then insert the the our current value (5) at the index where the shifting began in the list. Once this operation of shifting
and replacing is complete, we then print the list out and continue our traversal.

This process iterates until all elements in the list are sorted. Given this written description, we will start to make it more concrete with pseudocode seen below.

# PSEUDOCODE:

    Create variable idx to track our current index in the list
    Set idx to 1 (as the value at idx 0 in the list is sorted by default)
    WHILE IDX < LENGTH OF INPUT LIST:
        START LOOP (For all values i in the sequence to idx, do the following)
            1. if the number at idx is less than the number at idx, move to 2
                2. Store the value at arr[idx]
                3. shift all values to the right from i to idx in the original input list
                4. Insert the value stored in step 2 at index i in the array
                5. Break out of the loop and move to the next element to
                   be sorted in the list
        END LOOP

        Increment idx by 1 and continue while loop
    END WHILE

Given the complete pseudocode of the algorithm shown above, I will show the coding implementation of that algorithm below. A separate function to shift
the necessary values right per the algorithm above has been implemented as well. Additionally, a variable "printed" can be seen in the function
"insertionSort2" that tracks whether or not a sorting operation has been made, and likewise printed to the terminal throughout the algorithm.

It is also important to note that the code seen below, specifically in the "shift_right" function, takes advantage of the fact that
lists in python are passed between functions as pointers. Thus, the list does not need to be returned from the "shift_right" function
and the local modification to the list done in that function will propagate upwards to the "insertionSort2" function that called it.

# CODE:

    def shift_right(arr, start_idx, end_idx):
        for index in range(end_idx, start_idx, -1):
            arr[index] = arr[index-1]

    # Complete the insertionSort2 function below.
    def insertionSort2(n, arr):
        idx = 1

        while idx < len(arr):
            printed = False
            for i in range(idx):
                if arr[idx] < arr[i]:
                    sort_val = arr[idx]
                    shift_right(arr, i, idx)
                    arr[i] = sort_val
                    printed = True
                    print(''.join([f"{num} " for num in arr]))
                    break

            if not printed:
                print(''.join([f"{num} " for num in arr]))

            idx += 1

# CONCLUSION:

The algorithm above passes all tests in the hacker rank testing ground for the insertionSort2 function. I hope this explanation helped in understanding the method
behind the insertion sort algorithm. We will continue our exploration of sorting algorithms in future blog posts.
