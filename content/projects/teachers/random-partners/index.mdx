# PROBLEM:

Recently, I was given an interesting problem by a teacher that wanted to be able to assign partners
in her class at random, but wanted the added ability to avoid certain pairings if needed. Sounding
like an interesting problem, I dove head first into it and created a solution seen below. Let's go
through the code and discuss it.

# CODE:

    import random
    import sys

    total_students = 16

    if __name__ == "__main__":

        if total_students % 2 != 0:
            raise Exception("Total Students must be an even number.")

        # Create students dictionary. Key is the student number. Value
        # is a list containing integers representing student numbers
        # that are unacceptable partners in the classroom.
        students = {num+1: [] for num in range(total_students)}

        # Examples of students with unacceptable partner numbers.
        students[3].extend([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16])
        students[4].append(5)
        students[12].append(15)

        while students:
            # Assign partners to students that must avoid certain students first.
            sorted_students = sorted(
                students, key=lambda k: len(students[k]), reverse=True)

            current_student = sorted_students[0]

            # Unacceptable partners for the current student to be matched with a partner
            # are all the partners listed in the students dictionary (if any) for the current_student
            # in the students dictionary, as well as the current_student themselves as they cannot
            # partner with themselves.
            unacceptable_partners = students[current_student] + \
                [current_student]
            # Find the list of potential partners as the difference between the current
            # student list and the unacceptable partners for the current student.
            potential_partners = list(
                set(students) - set(unacceptable_partners))

            if potential_partners:
                found_partner = random.choice(potential_partners)
            else:
                found_partner = None

            if not found_partner:
                print("This run did not yield a match for the entire class.")
                print(
                    "Attempt to run again, or alter which students can be with other students.")
                sys.exit(1)
            else:
                students.pop(found_partner)
                students.pop(current_student)

                print(f"Partner Match: {found_partner} - {current_student}")

# EXPLANATION:

Let's go through the solution by sections.

    import random
    import sys

    total_students = 16

I'll need the sys and random libraries for this solution. I've also created an example variable of total_students, which I've set
to 16. For this program to work, the total students to be paired in the class will need to be an even number
so that everyone gets a partner, and there are safeguards in the program that ensure this.

        # Create students dictionary. Key is the student number. Value
        # is a list containing integers representing student numbers
        # that are unacceptable partners in the classroom.
        students = {num+1: [] for num in range(total_students)}

        # Examples of students with unacceptable partner numbers.
        students[3].extend([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16])
        students[4].append(5)
        students[12].append(15)

The first meaty portion of the program, I create a class dictionary called students. In this dictionary, each key will represent a student's number
as an integer, and the value for each key in that dictionary will be a list of students that cannot be paired with that particular student number.

The next three lines show students 3, 4 and 12 receiving students that cannot be paired together. Student 4 cannot be paired with student 5,
student 12 cannot be with 15, and student 3 can only be with student 15, an edge case to ensure the program is functioning properly.

    while students:
            # Assign partners to students that must avoid certain students first.
            sorted_students = sorted(
                students, key=lambda k: len(students[k]), reverse=True)

            current_student = sorted_students[0]

We then begin the task of assigning students together. We will loop through the students dictionary, continuing our pairing until the students
dictionary is empty, meaning we'll be popping students from the students class list as we pair them together.

The first thing we'll do in this loop is sort our students dictionary by the amount of students that a person cannot be partnered with, with
the students that have the most amount of students to avoid being paired first. This is an attempt to ensure that even the students with the
most partners to avoid have a chance at receiving a partner, setting that student to current_student.

    # Unacceptable partners for the current student to be matched with a partner
    # are all the partners listed in the students dictionary (if any) for the current_student
    # in the students dictionary, as well as the current_student themselves as they cannot
    # partner with themselves.
    unacceptable_partners = students[current_student] + \
        [current_student]
    # Find the list of potential partners as the difference between the current
    # student list and the unacceptable partners for the current student.
    potential_partners = list(
        set(students) - set(unacceptable_partners))

    if potential_partners:
        found_partner = random.choice(potential_partners)
    else:
        found_partner = None

Next, we create a list of potential partners for the current student. Fundamentally, this is the difference between the set of students in the
classroom by the set of unacceptable partners for that student. We define the list of unacceptable students to be partnered with the current
student as the current student (as they cannot partner with themselves) in addition to the list of unacceptable partners as defined
in the classroom dictionary.

Once that list of potential partners has been created, we select a partner from that list at random and label it as the found_partner for that
student. To avoid issues with no potential partners available (e.g. an input error where a student in the class is explicitly listed to avoid
all other students in the class) we set found_partners to None if the list of potential partners has nobody in it.

In the next portion of the program, we will throw an error if a student cannot be paired with a partner, and the pairing will stop.

    if not found_partner:
        print("This run did not yield a match for the entire class.")
        print(
            "Attempt to run again, or alter which students can be with other students.")
        sys.exit(1)
    else:
        students.pop(found_partner)
        students.pop(current_student)

        print(f"Partner Match: {found_partner} - {current_student}")

Finally, we reach the end of the loop. The error handling of not finding a partner can be seen at the first portion of the if statement above.
However, if a partner is found, we pop both the current student as well as the partner from the class list and print out the partner match to the
terminal. This will continue it's iteration until all students have a partner pairing and all pairings are printed to the terminal. :)

# CONCLUSION:

Hopefully this is a helpful program for many teachers, I'd love to hear if it has helped you with your classroom life. The current
program is implemented in python, however an application has also been created on this website that can be used in the browser,
which can be found here.
